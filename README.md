Exceptions
  You have already seen some exceptions...
    NullPointerException
    IndexOutOfBoundsException
    IOException
  These cause your program to halt
    Show the file and line number where the failure occurred
    Show the “stack trace” – the nested list of method calls that has brought us to the failure
Creating Exceptions
  Only create an exception if there isn't already one that does the job
 Extend an existing class
  Often Exception or RuntimeException
  Implement the constructors
  Add your own data
